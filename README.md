# My Dynamic Team Page - Kwency Maye Dahilan

The Dynamic Team Page project utilizes JavaScript to enhance the user experience by implementing hover and click functionalities on team member images. The page is not responsive, but when the user hovers over an image, it will turn to grayscale, providing a visual cue. Upon clicking an image, a headline and short bio for the team member will appear, giving users a more detailed understanding of each team member's role and background.
